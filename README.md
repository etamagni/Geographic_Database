# Geographic Records Database
Final Project for Database Systems course

In this database, information about geographic records is stored.  Such information pertains to various continents, countries, and cities in the world.  In addition to these, data about world currencies and languages is also stored.  This type of geographic database is designed to be used by a company seeking to store and gain insight on data about different locations.  Such attributes of the data are populations and areas of different places.  An application of this kind of database would be the performance of location analysis, in order for a company to determine what places might be suitable for business prospects.

This project encompasses an interactive database system front-end (HTML), back-end (Python), and MySQL server.
